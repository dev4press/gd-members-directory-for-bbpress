== Description ==
Easy to use plugin for adding forum members directory page into bbPress powered forums including members filtering and additional widgets for listing members in the sidebar. The plugin adds new URL endpoint based on the existing bbPress 'users' profile URL, and using theme compatibility method (the same as in bbPress), it adds the members directory with additional filters and sorting options.

The plugin has few settings, to control number of users per page, URL enpoint slug and few more things. The plugin features are listed here:

* Members list shows various user information
* Options to filter list by role or keyword
* Change results sorting (activity, registration, name...)
* Full RTL support for the directory styling
* Simple Widget for showing list of members

Plugin default templates and styling are based on the default bbPress theme package. And, like with bbPress, all the templates used by the plugin can be replaced via theme. The plugin has full support for [GD Quantum Theme Pro for bbPress](https://plugins.dev4press.com/gd-quantum-theme-for-bbpress/) plugin by Dev4Press, including additional templates and styling.
